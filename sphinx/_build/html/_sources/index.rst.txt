Welcome to Reheating by Scalaron Decay's documentation!
=======================================================

Python code for solving inflationary and reheating phase for
:math:`f(R) = R + {\alpha} R^2 + {\beta} R^2 {\ln} \frac{R}{{\mu}^2}` gravity.

This gravity model gives an inflationary phase and a subsequent reheating phase due to particle
creation at the expense of scalaron field. Presenting a plausible scenario of reheating obeying
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that imposes constraints on the particles that can be created in the
configuration space. The energy available in the scalaron field is sufficient to populate the entire
configuration space, the energy density of the particles grows, attaining a maximum value giving an efficient
reheating.
